We are currently working on a project that aimed to develop an end-to-end machine learning application that will ascertain individuals' exposure risk to COVID-19
## Abstract 
In the fight to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 infection, Artificial intelligence methods such as risk assessment tools have flooded the internet. These risk assessment questionnaires contain too many features that are time consuming, prediction of risk assessment status of individuals suffer from biasedness due to imbalanced classification problem. More so, it is difficult to prioritize significant features that best predicts individuals’ risk status to COVID-19 and trustworthiness of the risk assessment score. The major contributions of this study arise from the use of statistical feature selection (Correlation, LASSO shrinkage) and interpretable Machine learning models to classify, investigate, and explain most important features that predicts individual’s risk status to COVID-19 infection. 57 out of 59 features were first filtered for multicollinearity using the Pearson correlation coefficient (/Corr./< 0.80) and further shrunk to 55 features by LASSO GLM approach. The interpretable ML algorithms (Logistic Reg., Decision tree and Random Forest) were implored during the classification phase. The best winner’s classifier (Random classifier with validation accuracy score of 96.35% from 55 features reduced by feature selection methods) predictions were saved as new instance and perturbed using single decision tree classifier as local surrogate. The XGBoost classifier used as a global surrogate model to train these new instances from the Random forest classifier. The XGBoost individual’s explanation was done using the SHAP explainable AI-framework. This study identified COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 contacts, COVID-19 symptoms, Health workers and Public transport count as the five most consistent features that predicts individual’s risk exposure to COVID-19. Other notable features include heart disease, working, house count (number of people living in an apartment), contact counts, Nursing home, opinion infection (individual’s prior beliefs), kidney diseases, lung disease, diabetes, region, and alcohol. These factors are crucial and should be prioritize when developing smart and less time-consuming risk assessment tools.
