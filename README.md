## Machine_learning_against_COVID-19
We are currently working on a project that aimed to develop an end-to-end machine learning application that will ascertain individuals' exposure risk to COVID-19
## Abstract 
The continuous rise in the spread of the deadly “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) requires multifaceted drastic containment measures. Compared to other respiratory syndromes such as SARS or MERS, the COVID-19 exhibits strong infectivity but less virulence, meaning that it has higher morbidity but lower case-fatality-ratio (CFR). This characteristic imposes heavy demands on rapid and cost-effective detection of COVID-19 infection. While many COVID-19 test kits provide accurate results, they are not only expensive and tedious to use, but also require substantial time and expertise to analyze the samples, which largely limit the products to a small group of people. It is expected that the international outbreak of COVID-19 may last for months or longer and even pessimistically we may have to live with the virus for years. In light of this epidemic, it is extremely important and timely to develop a self-risk-assessment tool that is easily accessible to the public at no cost to monitor the wellness of both individuals and groups (regionally, nationally and even worldwide). In this project we propose an urgent end-to-end data-driven supervised machine learning (ML) approach that will ingest individual-level historical health data and behavioral health survey data to predict individual’s exposure risk status (High, Medium and Low), with regards to COVID-19. Some people exposed to the virus may notice certain symptoms of the infection as suggested by WHO, but they may downplay it; feeling reluctant to seek medical attention or report to local health authorities. Our ML application (web/phone-based) can serve as a convenient platform for anyone to assess their risk status and locate the nearest healthcare facilities, testing/reporting centers.
